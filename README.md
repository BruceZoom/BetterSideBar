# Better Sidebar

This is a mod for Stacklands and it aims to improve the usability of the sidebar.

It currently has the following features:
- __Pin your favorite ideas:__
  - Can pin or unpin an idea. When unpin an idea, it does not go to its original position until you move your mouse away, so that you get time to undo an unintentional unpin by pinning it again.
  - Pinned ideas will display at the top of each group in the order they got pinned.
  - Can filter ideas by displaying only pinned ones and new ideas.
  - Can reset all pins with one click on the reset button.
